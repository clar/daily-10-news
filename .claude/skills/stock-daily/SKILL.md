## Notes

- All text in **Chinese**
- **Do NOT insert any blockquote / 说明 / 日期范围说明 between the `#` H1 and the `## 今日焦点` heading.** The H1 should be immediately followed by `## 今日焦点`. If the date / session you cover needs clarifying, embed it inside the H1 itself or inside `## 今日焦点`; never as a leading note. Frontend renders markdown as-is and any leading note shows up above the focus section, which is unwanted.
- Use bold **bold** around headlines in the speed table
- Include specific prices with $ prefix ($425.30), percentages with sign (+2.3%, -1.8%), and large numbers with units ($42B market cap, $1.2T revenue)
- Category tags should be single words (2-3 Chinese characters max)
- "重点点评" should have an opinionated "角度" (angle) in the heading — not just restate the news
- During earnings season, prioritize major reporters (mega-caps, top banks, Dow components)
- Distinguish regular session moves vs. after-hours / pre-market moves when relevant
- If a market-moving macro event (CPI, FOMC, NFP) is happening, lead with it
